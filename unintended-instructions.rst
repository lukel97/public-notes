Unintended Instructions on X86

-------------------------------------------------


This document is (intended to eventually be) an overview of techniques for handling unintended instructions,  My hope is that this will be helpful to others, but the primary goal is to help me organize my own thoughts and wrap my head around the literature on the topic.  I've been doing work on this topic for a client, and will be sending a related proposal to llvm-dev in the near future.  Once complete, this writeup will serve as background for that proposal.
