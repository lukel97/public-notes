Working Notes on RISCV Targeted Work in LLVM
-------------------------------------------------

This directory contains my *working notes*.  This is posted publicly to allow collaboration with other *active LLVM contributors*.  This is not intended to be any form of authoritative commentary on the target or the outstanding work.

If you are a new contributor looking for ideas, you're welcome to review these notes, but you should form your own opinion on the validity of implementing something here.  Please do *not* cite this repo for motivation in patches.  Nearly by definition, things listed here are observations and thoughts I had while working on something else, and *not the thing I considered high priority at the time*.
