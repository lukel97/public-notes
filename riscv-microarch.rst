"Incredibly Scalable High-Performance RISC-V Core IP". `<https://www.sifive.com/blog/incredibly-scalable-high-performance-risc-v-core-ip>`_ -- Minimal information, but the point about being able to issue int ops to fp-pipe is interesting and not covered in the anandtech writeup.  

WikiChip. `<https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/sifive>`_ -- Some information on the various N-series cores, unclear sourcing and quality.
